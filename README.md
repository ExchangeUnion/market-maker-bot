# Market Maker Bot

## Arby
Arby is a market maker bot that allows to easily arbitrage between [OpenDEX](http://opendex.network/) and centralized exchanges like [Binance](https://www.binance.com). In other words, anyone with capital to spare is able to "earn interest" on their assets by running arby and providing liquidity to the OpenDEX network.

The overall goal of Arby is to pull liquidity from centralized exchanges into OpenDEX and incentivize this process financially.

### How it works
Arby looks for arbitrage opportunities on the OpenDEX network. It issues orders on OpenDEX based on the price of a connected centralized exchange, adding the configured `margin` on top. It will update the orders as soon as the price on the centralized exchange changes.

Trades on OpenDEX are settled in seconds. This allows arby to execute the counter trade on the connected centralized exchange right after an order is settled on OpenDEX. Since the order on OpenDEX was issued with an additional margin, the trade on the centralized exchange can almost always be settled for a significantly better price. The price difference between the two trades is the profit (the "interest") arby generates.

Example with real numbers:

- Balances before starting Arby

| Currency | OpenDEX | Binance |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| BTC      | 1.0     | 1.0     |
| USDT     | 11000   | 11000   |

- Total BTC balance between OpenDEX and Binance `1.0 + 1.0 = 2.0 BTC`
- Total USDT balance between OpenDEX and Binance `11000 + 11000 = 22000 USDT`

---
- Arby is started for BTC/USDT trading pair with 3% margin. The configured centralized exchange is Binance.
- Balance on OpenDEX is 1 BTC and 1 BTC on Binance
- USDT balance on OpenDEX is 10000 USDT and 10000 USDT on Binance
- Arby monitors the latest price of BTC/USDT on Binance. The latest price is $10000.
- Arby creates/updates the buy order on OpenDEX for `10000 - 0.03 * 10000 = $9700`.
- Arby creates/updates the sell order on OpenDEX for `10000 * 1.03 = $10300`.
- Whenever the latest price on Binance changes, Arby updates the orders on OpenDEX accordingly.

##### Scenario A
- OpenDEX buy order is filled and settled for 1 BTC ($9700).
- Arby issues a sell order on Binance for 0.97 BTC ($9700), locking in 0.03 BTC ($300) profit.
- Balances after scenario A

| Currency | OpenDEX | Binance |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| BTC      | 2.0     | 0.03    |
| USDT     | 1300    | 20700   |

- Total BTC balance between OpenDEX and Binance `2.0 + 0.03 = 2.03 BTC` (0.03 BTC yield)
- Total USDT balance between OpenDEX and Binance `1300 + 20700 = 22000 USDT`

---

##### Scenario B
- OpenDEX sell order is filled and settled for 1 BTC ($10300)
- Arby issues a buy order on Binance for 1.03 ($10300), locking in 0.03 BTC ($300) profit.

| Currency | OpenDEX | Binance |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| BTC      | 0       | 2.03    |
| USDT     | 21300   | 700     |

Total BTC balance between OpenDEX and Binance `2.0 + 0.03 = 2.03 BTC` (0.03 BTC yield)
Total USDT balance between OpenDEX and Binance `21300 + 700 = 22000 USDT`
